**Description:** Class 1 reviews two classic readings (by Solow and Romer) in economic growth theory, turns to a discussion of the innovation-related basis for growth in the 90â€™s, and notes through NSF data the effect of the economics of globalization and the comparative efforts of other competitor nations. Two elements of direct innovation policy will be introduced: R&D funding, (including the physical science R&D funding challenge) and science and technology education levels, with international comparisons. An investment firm paper will suggest how businesses look at these innovation issues. Part two of two.

**Instructor:** William Bonvillian
